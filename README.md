### README: **FibroPred Predictive System**

---

#### **Description**
FibroPred is a predictive system designed to analyze clinical data and provide predictions for specific medical outcomes related to fibrosis. The tool employs machine learning models, primarily Random Forest classifiers, to forecast the likelihood of various events or conditions, such as mortality, necessity for transplantation, and progressive disease.

The system provides an easy-to-use interface built with Gradio, allowing users to input feature values and obtain predictions. Models and their configurations are stored and loaded dynamically, ensuring modularity and adaptability.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Prediction Targets**:
   - **Death**: Likelihood of patient mortality based on clinical and diagnostic features.
   - **Binary Diagnosis**: Classification of patients into specific diagnostic categories.
   - **Necessity of Transplantation**: Assessment of whether a patient is likely to need a transplant.
   - **Progressive Disease**: Prediction of disease progression based on longitudinal data.

2. **Dynamic Model Loading**: Models and feature sets are loaded dynamically from a pre-configured directory (`models`).

3. **Gradio Interface**: A tabbed interface for each prediction target, where users can input values interactively and receive predictions in real-time.

---

#### **Predictive Features**
Below are the features used for prediction across all targets:

1. **Pedigree**: Represents the familial history related to fibrotic conditions.

2. **Age at diagnosis**: Age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.

3. **FVC (L) at diagnosis**: Forced vital capacity in liters at the time of diagnosis, reflecting lung function.

4. **FVC (%) at diagnosis**: Forced vital capacity as a percentage of the expected value for the patientâ€™s age and sex.

5. **DLCO (%) at diagnosis**: Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide as a percentage, measuring gas exchange efficiency in the lungs.

6. **RadioWorsening2y**: Radiological assessment of lung deterioration over two years.

7. **Severity of telomere shortening - Transform 4**: Indicates the degree of telomere shortening.

8. **Progressive disease**: Binary variable indicating whether the disease is progressive or stable.

9. **Biopsy**: Binary variable indicating whether a biopsy was performed.

10. **Genetic mutation studied in patient**: Binary variable indicating the presence of specific genetic mutations.

11. **Comorbidities**: Binary variable representing the presence of relevant comorbidities.

12. **Tobacco use**: Binary variable reflecting whether the patient has a history of tobacco use.
